## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to install anything?
**A:** No! Node.js and npm are already available. Just run `bash setup.sh`

### Q: How do I deploy this?
**A:** Follow the 15 phases in **DEPLOYMENT.md** (about 2-3 hours)

### Q: Can I add more games?
**A:** Yes! Copy a game file pattern in `backend/src/games/` and add the logic

### Q: Is the RNG secure?
**A:** Yes! It's all on the server. The frontend never knows the outcome until the server tells it.

**A:** Yes! Modify Tailwind colors in `frontend/tailwind.config.js` or edit CSS in `frontend/src/index.css`

### Q: How do I back up the database?
**A:** See **DEPLOYMENT.md** Phase 10 for automated backup setup

### Q: What if something breaks?
**A:** Check troubleshooting in **README.md** or **TESTING.md**
